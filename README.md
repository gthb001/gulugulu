# Brand New Food Delivery Service Platform Plan (gulugulu)
**An open-source food recommendation and takeout platform aimed at solving "mealtime decision fatigue" through personalized recommendations, community interaction, and decentralized demand-driven experiences, providing users with a brand new culinary journey.**

I've had this idea for a year now, but I feel I lack the resources to realize it alone. I believe that if we can develop this food delivery project, it would be truly remarkable, as the current giants in the takeout industry offer very monotonous experiences with little progress over the years.
We want to change the world of online food ordering and welcome developers, product managers, and cloud service experts to join the discussion.

At present, many capable programmers have been forced to change careers due to the impact of the times, but they possess rich technical experience and creativity, just lacking the right platform to continue showcasing their talents.
Is there a way to allow these optimized developers, as well as equally excellent product managers and operators, to collaborate online and jointly complete an innovative project within the open-source community?
For example, creating a unique food app ðŸ‘‰ an application that takes solving "mealtime decision fatigue" as its core, while also having commercial value and product appeal.

## I. Inspiration Origin

**Many people must have experienced this:**
At mealtimes, facing a dazzling array of food choices, they don't know what to eat. This may seem like a small issue, but from another perspective, it hides a huge business opportunity.
What if we could develop a brand new food app that accurately recommends users' favorite dishes and has unique value at both the business and product levels? What would that scene look like?

## II. Inspiration Architecture
The conceptual architecture of this food app is as follows:
**1 Personalized Meal Recommendations**

**Blind Recommendations:**
Provide users with blind recommendation features for three meals a day. Users can set conditions according to their preferences, such as cuisine, province, taste preferences, or even specialty dishes from around the world.
Once set, the app will automatically push food recommendations that match their preferences a few days or on the same day, allowing users to try different delicacies every day.

**Smart Wearable Device Integration:**
Combine with wearable devices such as watches and bracelets, and further optimize food recommendations based on users' physical data, such as heart rate and exercise volume. For example, if the user has a high level of exercise and needs to replenish more energy, the app will recommend some high-calorie, high-nutrition food; on the contrary, it will recommend some light and healthy diet.

**2 Precise Restaurant/Takeout Push**
When the app recommends some lunch categories, and the user is particularly interested in a certain dish and wants to enjoy it at noon,
The app will intelligently push information about restaurants or takeout services that can make this dish, allowing users to place orders quickly and meet their immediate needs.

**3 Decentralized User Demand Driven**
Demand initiation and community response: Centered on users, build a decentralized food demand system. If the food recommended by the app is exactly what the user wants to eat at noon,
But there are no nearby restaurants that provide it, then users can initiate a food wish in the community. When a certain number of users have the same demand,
The system can then release this demand information to the surrounding restaurants.
Restaurant response and takeout delivery: If a restaurant is willing to make this dish and complete it within the user'sé¢„å®šé¢„å®š time, then takeout can be sent separately to users who previously participated in the demand accumulation.
To avoid conflicts in time, this feature needs to be prepared in advance, for example, users can initiate demands before work or the day before, and restaurants also have enough time to prepare ingredients and arrange production.

**4 Food Community Plaza**

**Interest Exchange:**
When the app recommends tomorrow's lunch food, such as Suzhou shrimp noodles, if other users are also interested in this dish, they will receive a notice in the food community plaza.
The system will show that N people will enjoy the same food at noon tomorrow, and these users can unlock the communication function in the community and share their food experiences and recommendations within a certain period, forming an active food social circle.

**Expand Social and Sharing:**
Users can not only exchange food itself but also share drinks, snacks, and even restaurant environment and service experiences that go with it. In this way,
Users can not only meet their food needs but also make like-minded friends, expand their social circle, and increase the user stickiness of the app.

**5 Calorie and Health Reminder**

**Intelligent Monitoring and Reminder:**
The app will intelligently judge whether the daily food intake is too high based on the food consumed by the user and the user's activity volume. If the system detects that the user's daily food intake is too high,
It may burden the body and will promptly send a reminder to help users reasonably control their diet and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

**Healthy Eating Suggestions:**
In addition to reminders, the app can also provide users with some healthy eating suggestions, such as recommending some low-calorie, high-nutrition recipes,
Or suggesting that users appropriately increase their exercise volume, etc., so that users can enjoy food while also paying attention to their health.

**6 Diversified Food Recommendations**

**Afternoon Tea Recommendations:**
Food is not limited to meals, afternoon tea is also an indispensable part of people's lives. When users feel hungry in the afternoon and don't know what to drink,
The app can provide users with some references, such as boiled water, orange juice, iced coffee, and other beverages to meet users' food needs at different times.

**Other Scene Food Recommendations:**
In addition to afternoon tea, the app can also recommend corresponding food according to different scenes, such as parties, dates, overtime, etc.,
So that users can enjoy suitable food in various occasions and improve the quality of life.

## III. Project Feasibility Discussion
Although this inspiration sounds very beautiful, if you want to create a super takeout platform similar to a big factory, the cost is undoubtedly exorbitant. So, is it possible to make it an open-source project?
By attracting all kinds of talents to participate in maintenance and development, it can not only reduce development costs but also gather the wisdom of all parties to jointly promote the progress of the project.

**1 Advantages of Open Source Projects**
Talent Convergence: Open source projects can attract excellent developers, product managers, operators, etc. from all over the world to participate. These optimized talents have rich experience and solid professional skills,
Can bring different perspectives and innovative thinking to the project, jointly overcome technical difficulties, and improve the quality and level of the project.
Community Collaboration: The open-source community has a strong spirit of collaboration and a culture of sharing. Participants can communicate, learn, and share experiences in the community, and solve problems together. This collaborative model can not only improve development efficiency
But also promote the continuous development and optimization of the project.

**2 Exploration of Profit and Distribution Models**
Profit Possibility: Although open source projects themselves are free, this does not mean that they have no profit possibility. For example, profits can be achieved through advertising, paid memberships, value-added services, etc.
Cake Distribution: Regarding the profit distribution of open source participants, a flexible mechanism can be adopted. For example, according to the degree of participants' contribution to the project, such as the amount of code submission, the difficulty of function development, community activity, etc., to distribute the corresponding profit shares.
This can not only motivate participants to invest more actively in the project but also ensure the fairness and sustainability of the project.

## IV. Finally

Inspiration comes from the pain point in daily life of not knowing what to eat at mealtimes. We hope to provide users with a brand new food experience through personalized recommendations, community interaction, and decentralized demand-driven experiences.
At the same time, we also hope that this project can become a successful case in the open-source community, demonstrating the power of open source.
By the way, I don't know how to develop, I hope developers will actively communicate, I hope this project can be successful in N years, good luck.
